									<h2>Conclusion

                                <p>
                                    What I found through my data analysis is that there is one city out of all of the prospective cities I collected data on that stands out from the rest. The city that best aligns with the personal preferences of my husband and myself is 
                                    <b>Lacey, Washington.</b>
                                    <br />
                                    I worked in Lacey when we lived in Washington and I absolutely fell in love with it. However, I always assumed that it was too expensive for us, and that it probably wasn’t as good as it seemed. When I was able to use these tools to analyze the data, it taught me that not only is Lacey more affordable than our current city, but that it has much better stats than I realized. It is an extremely safe and beautiful city in a climate and state that we love. 
                                    
                                    <br />
                                    <a href="about.html" class="image main"><img src="IMG_6400.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <i>*note: I realize that there are very possibly cheaper “medium” or “small” sized cities in the midwest. I thought of collecting data for additional cities in that area, but I realized pretty early on in my research that the climate of the midwest isn’t a great fit for me (looking at you “extreme cold temperatures” and heavy snowfall), so I turned my focus toward the cities on the west coast and four corners area. </i>
