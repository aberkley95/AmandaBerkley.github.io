									<h2>City Comparison<br />
									Project Walkthrough</h2>
                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>Almost two years after moving back to Utah from the pacific northwest, my husband and I began to realize it wasn’t a great fit for us. We wondered if we should move back to Washington because we loved the climate there, find a different location near the four corners, or look in the midwest where the housing market is cheap.
                                        <br />
                                        I researched top cities in the US to live in, and found that there were many pros and cons to every area. I decided that I wanted to be able to compare these pros and cons in order to figure out which city had the most to offer us and best aligned with our personal preferences. I figured that the best way to do this was to collect data depicting the various stats that we cared about for lots of potential cities in order to find where the best place is for us to move and put down roots for our daughter.
                                        <br />
                                        I began collecting data for cities in Utah, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, California, Michigan and Illinois. We had never been to the midwest, but a lot of cities in Michigan and Illinois appeared on many lists for the “top cities to live in America”. I also included a bunch of cities across the pacific northwest because we loved it there, but were unsure if we could afford it. I also added cities in Utah even though we knew we didn’t like the climate or culture as much, but it did have some pros, including being close to friends. I included the cities that my husband and I grew up in as well. These were added less as prospective cities, and more of a comparison for size and climate because these are cities we are familiar with.
                                        <br />
										When I was inputting city data into my spreadsheet, I sometimes accidentally copy/pasted some leading spaces, some unintentional punctuation, and other things that could mess with analyzing the data. Luckily, I knew this could be easily cleaned in SQL
									</p>
								
								<h3><a href="https://github.com/aberkley95/SQL-Project/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Cleaning%20Cities.sql">SQL</a></h3>
                                <p> After collecting the raw data I used MySQL to clean and standardize the data. I first created a second cities table to manipulate to ensure I still had a backup of the original data. 
                                    <br />
                                    Throughout this process I not only found leading zeros and some random periods, but there were a couple duplicates and a null value as well. 
                                    <br />
                                    First, I used the TRIM function for removing any leading and trailing zeros. I then used SELECT DISTINCT for various columns, including the “state” column, where I found multiple “California” inputs. This is where I noticed an unintentional period distinguishing it as a separate input. I used UPDATE and SET to fix this issue. 
                                    <br />
                                    I also noticed some of the names of the columns were weird. For instance “ï»¿State” rather than “state”. I used ALTER TABLE and RENAME to fix any column names that seemed weird or bulky. Once all of the columns appeared standardized, I moved on to removing duplicates and null values.
                                    <br />
                                    I created a “city ID” column and used window functions to find duplicate data. From there I used INNER JOIN to delete these duplicates while leaving an original, which was made possible using the city ID column. 
                                    <br />

                                    <br />
                                </p>
                                <h3><a href="https://1drv.ms/x/c/c8f3693fc698fbe1/IQQGEZGhP6jTSYjmXIL1OSwaAS8domEFtiZEXmDk5pT6guw?em=2&ActiveCell='Dashboard'!A1&wdHideGridlines=True&wdHideHeaders=True&wdDownloadButton=True&wdInConfigurator=True&wdInConfigurator=True">Excel</a></h3>
                                <p>	Once my data was cleaned, I went back into Excel to make an interactive dashboard. This was probably my favorite project, because I was able to make a bunch of graphs and slicers that made it easy to compare how each city ranked in specific areas. 
                                    <br />
                                    For instance, I made a slicer where you can filter the graphs by the political leaning, or the distance from the airport, or the humidity levels. I also used calculated fields to label a lot of these conditions, including labeling humidity levels as: very dry, dry, comfortable, humid, and wet. This showed me that every city I collected fell within the “comfortable” or “dry”  range. 
                                    <br />
                                    One thing that my husband and I realized we don’t like about Utah is the extreme temperatures, so I also made a calculated field that took the difference of the average high temperatures and the average low temperatures to see how many degrees (Farenheit) the temperature varied. I labeled anything more than a 50 degree difference as “extreme” and anything less as “mild”. I then made a slicer that made it easy to filter these climate types. 
                                    <br />
                                    I also grouped together the areas that we like to see lower numbers for. These included the crime rates, air quality index, state nature rating and state school rating. For all of these, the lower numbers are better, so I could more easily visualize how each city ranked in these areas by comparing the totals and ordering my graphs smallest to biggest.
                                    <br />
                                    My takeaway from my Excel project was that generally speaking, the pacific northwest met a lot of our conditions, and didn’t differ much on housing prices when compared to where we live now (Utah). My other takeaway was that Utah has really bad air quality, and is a lot more dry and expensive than we prefer.  
                                    <br />
                                    My Excel dashboard can be accessed through the homepage, or <a href="https://1drv.ms/x/c/c8f3693fc698fbe1/IQQGEZGhP6jTSYjmXIL1OSwaAS8domEFtiZEXmDk5pT6guw?em=2&ActiveCell='Dashboard'!A1&wdHideGridlines=True&wdHideHeaders=True&wdDownloadButton=True&wdInConfigurator=True&wdInConfigurator=True">here.</a>
                                    <br />
                                </p>
                                <h3><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amanda.berkley/viz/CityComparison_17286749006920/Dashboard1">Tableau</a></h3>
                                <p>
                                    I picked the top cities in the areas that matter most to us, including humidity, housing prices, crime rates, nature rating and political leaning, and decided to use Tableau to compare more details of these cities in a closer look. I originally was going to pick the top 5, but I ended up adding a couple other cities that I wanted to take a closer look at, making it the top 7.
                                    <br />
                                    I included the median rent for a three bedroom house (knowing that is the size we want), the percentage of the religious population. I also collected more stats, like the school district rating, the homeless population, and the walk score of each of these cities. 
                                    <br />
                                    My findings from my Tableau project made me feel like either Bremerton or Lacey, Washington would be the best fit for us in terms of these stats. They were very comparable but with Lacey having the lowest crime rate and lower rent costs, but also the lowest walk score. Bremerton had a much better walk score, but is also quite a bit higher in crime and has a higher homeless population as well. Both cities cost about the same as the city we currently live in, but have a lot more pros and less cons than we find here. 
                                    <br />
                                    After this project, I still wasn’t completely sure which of the two cities would be best for us. I decided I needed to analyze my data with SQL in order to further compare and contrast these cities, and see if there’s another city that might be better. So I went back to MySQL Workbench to use some queries to explore this data.
                                    <br />
                                    You can view my Tableau dashboard from the homepage, or <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amanda.berkley/viz/CityComparison_17286749006920/Dashboard1">here.</a>
                                    <br />
                                </p>
                                <h3><a href="https://github.com/aberkley95/SQL-Project/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Analysis%20Cities.sql">SQL</a></h3>
                                <p>
                                    I used this question to inspire my queries, but I first had to standardize further data in order to analyze it with ease. Some of the calculated fields I made in Excel were numbered to order the buttons in a way that made sense to me. For example, I wanted the sizes of the cities ordered from smallest to biggest, rather than alphabetically, so I numbered them to show up this way. I knew these numbers would get in the way of my analysis so I altered my secondary table. To do this, I used the SET WHERE and LIKE functions to replace the numbered sizes with unnumbered sizes.
                                    <br />
                                    I then began to explore my data. I first found the cheapest city to live in based on the median income by using SELECT MIN(home_cost) and found the answer to be Springfield, Illinois. I used the same function to find the city with the lowest crime rate, which ended up being Pleasant Grove, Utah. 
                                    <br />
                                    Now I wanted to see which cities checked more than one box. In Excel I had labeled the various sizes of cities including rural, small, medium, large and metropolis. We have lived in very rural areas to metropolis sized cities, and have found that we prefer medium sized cities. I used SELECT and SELECT MIN() to find that the most affordable city that was medium sized is Lacey, Washington. 
                                    <br />
                                    This was surprising to me as I included multiple medium sized cities in Utah, California and Oregon. (In the midwest I had mainly added bigger cities) I expected Utah to be the cheapest generally, with Oregon still being cheaper than Washington, but based solely on cities that were medium sized, and the median housing costs, Lacey, WA is cheapest.
                                    <br /> 
                                    Next I used the SELECT MIN( ) function again to find that the city with the lowest crime rate and a comfortable humidity level is Bainbridge Island, Washington. I have visited there and while I would love to live there, it’s one of the most expensive cities I collected data for. 
                                    <br />
                                    I used SELECT MAX( ) to find that the city with the highest average income that is also liberal leaning is Redmond, Washington. This didn’t surprise me and while interesting, Redmond is also one of the most expensive cities I collected. 
                                    <br />
                                    I decided that I needed to see if there was any one city that checked all of my boxes that matter most to me. I wanted to know if such cities exist, which is the most affordable?
                                    <br />
                                    To find this I first decided which conditions were the most important to me. Next I filtered the cities by these conditions. Which are: the humidity is “comfortable”, the air quality average is less than 50, the political leaning is “liberal”, and the size is “medium”. This pulled up only two results, meaning only 2 of the 50 cities I collected data for checked all of these boxes. Those cities are Olympia, Washington, and Lacey, Washington.
                                    <br />
                                    I then pulled up the median housing cost and crime rate of just these two cities to compare and see which of these two options scores better in those areas. What I found was that Lacey, Washington had both a lower median home cost as well as a lower crime rate. 
                                    <br />
                                    Before I called it a day, I wanted to compare Lacey to some of the small sized cities. Even though our preference is medium, we have also enjoyed living in small cities as well. I also noticed that I had collected more small cities than medium in my dataset. To compare these cities, I again filtered by cities which met my previous conditions: comfortable humidity, good air quality, and liberal leaning. However, this time I changed the medium requirement to WHERE city = ‘small’. This brought up only two cities which met all of my conditions, both in Washington. Those cities are Bremerton and Puyallup. 

                                    <br />
                                    I pulled up the home costs and crime rates of all four cities: Bremerton, Lacey, Olympia, and Puyallup. What I found was that Lacey still had the lowest crime rate, but was only the second most affordable. Bremerton has a slightly cheaper median home cost than Lacey, being 457,600 to Lacey’s 467,900. But Bremerton also had a significantly higher crime rate. In fact, Bremerton had the highest of all four cities at 31.8, while Lacey’s crime rate is 17.6. 
                                    <br />
                                    The choice of crime rate vs low housing cost is a personal one to make, but I personally would take the second cheapest of these cities because the feeling of a safe city is more important to me. To me the difference between the two cities' home costs felt negligible when compared to the staggering difference in crime rates, which almost doubles from Lacey to Bremerton. (31.8 / 17.6 = 1.8)

                                    <br />

                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>
                                    What I found through my data analysis is that there is one city out of all of the prospective cities I collected data on that stands out from the rest. The city that best aligns with the personal preferences of my husband and myself is 
                                    <b>Lacey, Washington.</b>
                                    <br />
                                    I worked in Lacey when we lived in Washington and I absolutely fell in love with it. However, I always assumed that it was too expensive for us, and that it probably wasn’t as good as it seemed. When I was able to use these tools to analyze the data, it taught me that not only is Lacey more affordable than our current city, but that it has much better stats than I realized. It is an extremely safe and beautiful city in a climate and state that we love. 
                                    
                                    <br />

                                    <i>*note: I realize that there are very possibly cheaper “medium” or “small” sized cities in the midwest. I thought of collecting data for additional cities in that area, but I realized pretty early on in my research that the climate of the midwest isn’t a great fit for me (looking at you “extreme cold temperatures” and heavy snowfall), so I turned my focus toward the cities on the west coast and four corners area.</i>
