									<h2>Excel Dashboard<br />
									Project Explanation</h2>
                                <h3><a href="https://excel.cloud.microsoft/open/onedrive?docId=C8F3693FC698FBE1%21sa1911106a83f49d388e65c82f5392c1a&driveId=C8F3693FC698FBE1">Excel Dashboard</a></h3>
                                <p>	Once my data was cleaned, I went back into Excel to make an interactive dashboard. This was probably my favorite project, because I was able to make a bunch of graphs and slicers that made it easy to compare how each city ranked in specific areas. 
                                    <br />
                                    For instance, I made a slicer where you can filter the graphs by the political leaning, or the distance from the airport, or the humidity levels. I also used calculated fields to label a lot of these conditions, including labeling humidity levels as: very dry, dry, comfortable, humid, and wet. This showed me that every city I collected fell within the “comfortable” or “dry”  range. 
                                    <br />
                                    One thing that my husband and I realized we don’t like about Utah is the extreme temperatures, so I also made a calculated field that took the difference of the average high temperatures and the average low temperatures to see how many degrees (Farenheit) the temperature varied. I labeled anything more than a 50 degree difference as “extreme” and anything less as “mild”. I then made a slicer that made it easy to filter these climate types. 
                                    <br />
                                    I also grouped together the areas that we like to see lower numbers for. These included the crime rates, air quality index, state nature rating and state school rating. For all of these, the lower numbers are better, so I could more easily visualize how each city ranked in these areas by comparing the totals and ordering my graphs smallest to biggest.
                                    <br />
                                    My takeaway from my Excel project was that generally speaking, the pacific northwest met a lot of our conditions, and didn’t differ much on housing prices when compared to where we live now (Utah). My other takeaway was that Utah has really bad air quality, and is a lot more dry and expensive than we prefer.  
                                    <br />
