                                <h3><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amanda.berkley/viz/CityComparison_17286749006920/Dashboard1">Tableau Dashboard</a></h3>
                                <p>
                                    I picked the top cities in the areas that matter most to us, including humidity, housing prices, crime rates, nature rating and political leaning, and decided to use Tableau to compare more details of these cities in a closer look. I originally was going to pick the top 5, but I ended up adding a couple other cities that I wanted to take a closer look at, making it the top 7.
                                    <br />
                                    I included the median rent for a three bedroom house (knowing that is the size we want) and the percentage of the religious population to get a feel for the culture and vibe. I also collected more stats, like the school district rating, the homeless population, and the walk score of each of these cities. 
                                    <br />
                                    My findings from my Tableau project made me feel like either Bremerton or Lacey, Washington would be the best fit for us in terms of these stats. They were very comparable but with Lacey having the lowest crime rate and lower rent costs, but also the lowest walk score. Bremerton had a much better walk score, but is also quite a bit higher in crime and has a higher homeless population as well. Both cities cost about the same as the city we currently live in, but have a lot more pros and less cons than we find here. 
                                    <br />
                                    After this project, I still wasn’t completely sure which of the two cities would be best for us. I decided I needed to analyze my data with SQL in order to further compare and contrast these cities, and see if there’s another city that might be better. So I went back to MySQL Workbench to use some queries to explore this data.
                                    <br />
